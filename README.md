## ✋ Hand Tracking Projects – Virtual Mouse & Volume Control

This section showcases a set of **AI-powered hand gesture control systems** that enhance **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** by enabling **touchless input mechanisms**. These projects leverage **real-time hand tracking** with **MediaPipe** and **OpenCV** to control the mouse and system volume using only hand gestures, without relying on external sensors or specialized hardware.

These systems are lightweight, fast, and work fully offline, making them ideal for smart environments, accessibility solutions, or futuristic user interface demos.

### ✅ Projects Included

#### 🖱️ Virtual Mouse
A virtual mouse system that tracks hand movements via webcam and translates them into mouse cursor actions.  
- Move the cursor using hand motion  
- Perform **left click**, **right click**, and **drag-and-drop** with specific finger gestures  
- Great for **gesture-controlled desktops** and smart screen setups  
- Ideal for people with mobility limitations as an assistive tech solution

#### 🔊 Advanced Volume Control
A gesture-based volume controller that detects hand pinching movements to adjust system volume.  
- Increase/decrease volume by changing the **distance between thumb and index finger**  
- Real-time feedback with optional on-screen volume display  
- Built using **Pycaw** to interface with system audio APIs on Windows  
- Useful in media centers, smart TV environments, or hands-free workplaces

### 💡 Highlights
- ✋ **Accurate real-time hand tracking** powered by Google’s **MediaPipe** framework  
- ⚡ Fast and smooth operation — optimized for low latency with normal webcams  
- 💻 **Fully offline** — works without internet or external sensors  
- 🤖 Supports development of **smart interfaces**, **AI demos**, **accessibility tools**, and **gesture-based UX prototypes**

---

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** – core programming language  
- **OpenCV** – for image/video processing and rendering  
- **MediaPipe** – for hand landmark detection and tracking  
- **Pycaw** – to control system audio (Windows only)  
- **NumPy**, **math** – for geometric calculations and smoothing
