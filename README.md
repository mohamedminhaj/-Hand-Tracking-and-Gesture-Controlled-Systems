✋ Hand Tracking Projects (Virtual Mouse & Volume Control)

A set of gesture-controlled applications using real-time hand tracking to simulate touchless interaction with your computer. Built with OpenCV and Google's MediaPipe, these projects demonstrate innovative ways to control your system using only hand gestures.



✅ Projects Included

🖱️ Virtual Mouse

- Use hand gestures to move the cursor, perform clicks, and drag-and-drop

- Mimics physical mouse functionality using just your fingers

- Works smoothly with standard webcams

🔊 Advanced Volume Control

- Adjust system volume by pinching your index finger and thumb

- Dynamic volume change based on the distance between fingertips

- Smooth volume scaling and visual feedback




💡 Highlights

✋ Real-time and precise hand landmark detection using MediaPipe

⚡ High frame-rate performance for seamless user experience

💻 Fully offline with no special hardware required — just a webcam

🤖 Ideal for accessibility tools, smart interfaces, and contactless control applications
